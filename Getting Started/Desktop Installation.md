# KDX: Desktop Installation Guide

The Kaspa Desktop Experience (KDX) application provides a user interface for running a full Kaspa node (Kaspad) in a desktop operating system environment. The application is intended for both software developers and non-technical users.

KDX includes a wallet for performing Kaspa transactions.

## Key Features

The KDX application enables the user to do the following:

- Install, configure and run a full Kaspa node (Kaspad) on the user&#39;s computer
- Run a Kaspad on Testnet or on Mainnet and easily switch between the networks
- Create a local, self-contained Testnet for running Kaspa (including mining)
- Send and receive funds using a wallet

## Download and Installation

**To install the KDX application:**

1. Download the KDX binaries from [https://kdx.app](https://kdx.app/).
2. Run the file kdx-v1.4.0-windows-x64.exe.
3. Follow the instructions to install KDX.


    The KDX GUI window opens. The Wallet tab is displayed.

    A Kaspa node (Kaspad) is up and running on Testnet.

## Operation

When opened, the KDX GUI is in Advanced mode (see below) and displays six tabs, of which the following three are standard (non-Advanced):

- Kaspa
- Settings
- Wallet

### Kaspa Tab

The Kaspa tab shows the status of the locally running full Kaspa node (Kaspad).

- Storage Rate – average yearly rate of adding new blocks (hourly rate extrapolated for a year)
- Network Name – Kaspa-Testnet or Kaspa-Mainnet
- Peers – number of peers the Kaspad is connected to
- Blocks – number of blocks the Kaspad has
- Difficulty – a network parameter (integer)
- Median Time – network time calculated from block timestamps
- Mempool Size – number of pending transactions (broadcasted but not accepted)

#### Kaspaminer

Kaspaminer can be running or stopped depending on whether the Enable Mining checkbox is checked in the Settings tab (see below).
